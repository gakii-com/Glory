# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🧮

A lighthearted calculator that lets you **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, and **divide** two numbers like a boss! 😎✨

## 🚀 Features

* Handles **decimals** with style using `float()` 🧙‍♂️
* Performs **four basic math operations**:

  * ➕ Addition
  * ➖ Subtraction
  * ✖️ Multiplication
  * ➗ Division (assuming you’re not dividing by zero… you rebel!)
* Prints results in a clean, friendly format 🎯

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **User Input**

   * The program asks for the first number.
   * The program asks for the second number.
   * Both numbers are converted to `float` to support decimals.

2. **Math Magic** ✨

   * Calculates sum, difference, product, and quotient.

3. **Results** 🎊

   * Displays each result with a clear label.

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.x

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the script as `fun_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter your numbers.

## ⚠️ Notes

* Division by zero will cause an error—be kind to your calculator! ❤️
* Only works with numeric input (no, “potato” is not a number 🥔).

## 💡 Example Run

```
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 4
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 16.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 3.125
```
